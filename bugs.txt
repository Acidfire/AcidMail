bugs:

Connection errors report socket error numbers, but there is no socket error, report response or failure instead.

todo: 

Getting headlines for imap
Set SHSetUnreadMailCount

Rework error reporting system.
if you make per mailbox bangs, put global bangs in main.cpp and mailbox bangs in mailbox.h (not check/clearmail! has to be in acidmail or main)
secure pop3 and secure imap
