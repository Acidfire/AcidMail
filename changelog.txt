Change Log:

15-03-09: -Unregistering windowclass on failure of window creation.
09-06-08: -Made pop3 subject checking work.
		  -Fixed bug where AcidMail could go into an endless loop if a connection error
			occurred during graceful shutdown.
08-06-08: -Wrote pop3 subject checking code, still buggy though.
07-06-08: -Added first subject checking code.
		  -Removed bang.cpp/.h.
05-06-08: -Fixed connection error reporting a socket error number when there was no socket
			error.
13-05-08: -Made IMAP work again, cleaned up some code and reduced file size.
12-05-08: -Added !AcidMailSetPass (server) (user) (password). Before saved passwords couldn't
			be modified once stored, now they can.
11-05-08: -Put server responses in errors when applicable.
10-05-08: -Error interface now takes strings instead of numbers, $AcidMail<Name>Error$ now
			returns the error string.
		  -Put socket in in mailbox object thus no longer sending sockets around in function
			calls.
23-04-08: -Replaced ugly imap recent mail number checking algorithm with a slightly less ugly
			algorithm.
27-02-08: -Fixed some error messages which weren't working.
26-02-08: -More graceful closing of connection if whole communication succeeds.
19-02-08: -Using getaddrinfo now instead of gethostbyname and gethostbyaddr. This doesn't
			just make the code simpler, but now AcidMail also supports domains which have
			multiple homes. It will try connect to all of them untill it works. This should
			make AcidMail more reliable.
		  -Made AcidMail use Winsock 2.2. This breaks compatibility with old (pre-osr2) win95
			builds.
31-01-08: -Fixed regression introduced in 0.7 pre-build.
11-01-08: -Put WSAStartup in main
		  -Added an extra error message (10).
10-01-08: -Added 2 missing mailbox notifications to 2 warnings.
08-01-08: -Did some minor cleanup/changes.
02-01-08: -Mailboxes now export their error number to $AcidMail<Name>Error$.
		  -Some code cleanup.
30-12-07: -Fixed a memory leak in the Encrypt function. (now there's is no more code from LSMail!)
		  -Fixed a posible race condition when closing the mailchecking thread.

Version 0.6:

29-12-07: -Added new multiline syntax. This was needed because the single line syntax would
			become unreadable if new features we're added.
		  -Added the ability to specify which folder should be checked when using imap.
		  -Code cleanup by using initialization lists.
11-10-07: -Added some safety checks for window creating and some minor cleanups.
16-08-07: -Timer is now called after the mail checking thread is done instead of during. This
			prevents the thread from running twice (if the thread lasts longer than
			$AcidMailTimer$).
30-07-07: -Changed hwndParent in DialogBox call to NULL
		  -Commented out Passproc in main.h

Version 0.5:

28-07-07: -Got IMAP checking to work!
		  -Removed all server debugging code. Will now use normal debug and sniffing instead.
27-07-07: -Fixed a memory leak. The CheckMailThread's handle wasn't removed thus the stack space
			would remain in memory.
		  -Rewrote Pop3Check() and reorganised normal and debug versions of ***Check() functions.
22-07-07: -Rewrote some more of Mailcheck(). closesocket() and WSACleanup() are now only called
			in the error handler or at the end of Mailcheck().
20-07-07: -Rewrote most of Mailcheck(), this removed redundant code and made NumMail an unsigned
			int so the maximum number of mail is now 65535.
14-07-07: -Made bigger parts of the Acidmail and Mailbox class private. Mailbox::ClearMail created.
		  -An extern pointer to the acidmail instance in mailbox.cpp is removed.
		  -Rewrote the way mailbox errors are handled: mailbox error is now flagged in Mail struct
			and	returned to the checkmail thread. This fixes the problem where ErrorCmd was fired
			for every failed mailbox.
03-07-07: -Begon writing of ImapCheck() (Imap mail checking).

Version 0.3:

28-06-07: -All globals needed from other files are now included with extern instead of #include,
			excluding const value's (version info).
		  -Fixed encrypted password storing.
27-06-07: -The Acidmail constructor no longer takes arguments. hWnd and hInst are gotten from
			main.h via extern.
		  -Removed AcidMailNoMessageBoxes, since there aren't any message boxes (yet).
26-06-07: -Implemented encrypted password storing. (Copied and then slightly modified LsMail's
			method :P) Now you don't need to put your password in an .rc file anymore. Instead a
			dialogue will popup to ask you for it the first time you connect to a server.
		  -Added support for using the ip address of the host.
		  -Added support for specifying the port to connect to: "mail.host.com:965". If no ":" is 
			found, port 110 is used
24-06-07: -Decided to be nicer to mailservers: Now sending quit before closing socket.
23-06-07: -Increased buffers for *line reading. Caused crash when misconfiguring.
		  -Increased buffer for number of mails (max is now 32768 instead of 9999).
14-06-07: -Made AcidMailErrorCmd work.
		  -Made ErrorHandler which posts errors in the logfile.
12-06-07: -Made Reading *lines a bit safer.
		  -Added AcidMailFoundMailCmd: fired if it finds mail, regardless of the value before.
07-06-07: -Added AcidMailZeroMailCmd: fired if it finds 0 mail even if there was 0 before checking.

Version 0.2:

06-06-07: -Made !AcidMailClearMail correctly set all value's to 0 and made it fire NoMailCmd.
05-06-07: -Disabled checking mail when AcidMailTimer is set to 0.
04-06-07: -Made the readme using xDocs.

Version 0.1:

04-06-07: -Got Cmd's working although I have no idea what I've changed.
02-06-07: -Added Cmd's ("AcidMailMailCmd", AcidMailNoMailCmd etc.) Only "AcidMailErrorCmd"
			isn't implemented yet.
		  -Added support for more than 9 mails.
		  -Made NumMails return -1 on failure.
01-06-07: -Got mail checking to work propperly. (Need to make it more failsafe though.)
30-05-07: -Implemented actual checking of mail.
19-03-07: -Implemented encryption of password (copied from LsMail-4.4). For pass saving.
17-03-07: -Made CheckMail() work in a seperate thread.
16-03-07: -Made timer work (calls checkmail every X seconds)
15-03-07: -Fixed a buffer overflow error.
14-03-07: -Made Acidmail destructor destroy Mailboxes.
07-03-07: -Made Mailbox class and made *AcidMailbox parser.
05-03-07: -Implemented reading the RC settings.
24-02-07: -Added support for LM_REFRESH.
22-02-07: -Started building the Acidmail class, used AcidModule template for module basis.
